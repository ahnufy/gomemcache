This is a memcache client package for the Go programming language.
The following commands are implemented:
* get (single-key)
* set, add, replace, append, prepend
* delete
* incr, decr

Basic guidelines:
* Compile with "make".
* Start memcached at 127.0.0.1:11211 before running the test.
* Test with "make test".
* To compile memcache_example.go, compile memcache.go first.
